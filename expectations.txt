I expect to be finally be free from this course. This is actually my nth take because every single time, I would always have to apply for LOA midsemester. It's a curse, one that Im hoping to get rid of. While that sounds harsh and indifferent, I actually want to learn a lot from this subject as being a full stack developer is one of the career paths that Im considering taking. Its in demand, has a high pay grade and most importantly, a high possibility that its a WFH arrangment. These are my expectations for myself for the course itself. I dont have much expectations for the exercises, exams or project. It is what it is. I just hope that the project or exercises is machine friendly if we were to do it at home as my war machine aka laptop is already on its last legs. I am telling you, people, it will blue screen if you so much as sneeze at it. For the professors though,  I got none to be honest. First of all, within the classroom walls, they are the judge, jury and executioner hence its our job as the students to adapt, learn and comply. while its important to understand that while its their job or passion to impart knowledge to us, learning is a two way road and they are still only human therefore the results aka the grade is solely a product of our efforts and knowledge and not dependent to whether the professor is good at teaching the course. So no pressure, Sir Carl.
